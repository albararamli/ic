# Initial Contact Detection: Accelerometer Signal Analysis

This repository contains code for detecting initial contact (IC) events in raw accelerometer signals. The program identifies IC events for each step, depicted as red dots, determines the start and end of each step (duration), shown by gray borders, and estimates the total number of steps.
