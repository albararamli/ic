# Initial Contact (IC) Detection in Accelerometer Signals

This repository hosts the code for detecting Initial Contact (IC) events from raw accelerometer signals. The code identifies each step's IC events (visualized as red dots), marks the beginning and end of each step (duration, depicted with gray borders), and estimates the total step count.

## Visualization
Below are examples demonstrating the input and output from the IC detection process:
